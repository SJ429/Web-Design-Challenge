## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations cities.csv.

In building this dashboard, individual pages for each plot and a means by which the pages can navigate between them. 
These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. 
A landing page, a page where that can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where with the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page(#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* visualization pages each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
*   A Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
